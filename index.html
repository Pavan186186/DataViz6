            <h2>The Complex Reality of Police Use of Force</h2>
            <p>
                Every year,thousands of lives are irrevocably changed by police use of force in the United States.
                It is a subject that divides the nation, sparking intense debate in living rooms and legislative halls
                alike.
                On one side, there is the perspective of law enforcement—a difficult, dangerous job where split second
                decisions must be made to protect the public from armed threats.
                From this view, the data reveals a consistent, predictable pattern of response to danger.

            <p>
                On the other side, there is the cry for justice from communities who feel targeted.
                They point to a heartbreaking reality where some citizens, perticularly Black Americansare far more
                likely to lose their lives even when they pose no immediate threat.
                Using data from the <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings/blob/master/v2/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv"
                    target="_blank">Washington Post Police Shootings Database</a>,
                we explore these two deeply human,yet opposing narratives.

                <p class="caption">
                    Figure-1:- Year after year,the number of fatal incidents remains remarkably steady.
                    This consistency suggests that police use of force is not spiraling out of control, but rather is a
                    predictable response to a constant level of armed threats in society.

                    <h4>The Narrative of Stability</h4>
                    <p>
                        This visualization invites you to see the "system" at work. By showing the flat,unwavering
                        trend line,we argue that these incidents are not random acts of violence, but a stable
                        phenomenon driven by external factors primarily the presence of armed suspects.
                        The calm blue tones and the "Official Report" aesthetic are designed to evoke trust and
                        authority, suggesting that the situation is being managed with consistency.

                <p class="caption">
                    Figure-2:- Behind the numbers are human lives,and the burden is not shared equally.
                    Black citizens are disproportionately killed while unarmed, highlighting a systemic failure that
                    leaves some communities far more vulnerable than others.

                    <h4>The Narrative of Injustice</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here,we shift the focus to the victims. By highlighting the "Unarmed" cases the most tragic and
                        preventable deaths we challenge the notion of justification.
                        The stark red colors and the "Activist" design language are meant to alarm and provoke.
                        We explicitly compare the rates between races to show that for Black Americans the safety net
                        is thinner, and the risk is tragically higher.
